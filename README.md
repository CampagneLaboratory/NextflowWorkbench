The Nextflow workbench is a set of languages developed with the Jetbrains MPS Language Workbench that make it easier to write data analysis workflows with Nextflow.

The Nextflow Workbench has several features that complement the Nextflow middleware:

* it provides a WYSIWYG editor to write analysis workflows meant to be deployed in docker containers;
* it provides a custom typesystem that detects incompatible type assignments and reports them directly in the editor;
* it enables the reuse and composition of Nextflow processes across workflows;
* it provides seamless language composition as an effective extension and customization mechanism.
